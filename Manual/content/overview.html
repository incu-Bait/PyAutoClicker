    <h2>Pyscript</h2>
    <p>
        Pyscript uses Python and a custom ScriptAPI / reads .py files.  
        Only certain builtins and modules like <strong class="Style">random</strong> and <strong class="Style">time</strong> are allowed.
        if you cant find a Reference or or Builtins scan through the code, this doc is still being worked 
        on so it might be missing some stuff.
